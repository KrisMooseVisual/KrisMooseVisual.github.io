    <h1>Welcome to the realm of KrisMoose Visual Studio</h1>
    <p>
        This page is dedicated to the visual designs made by myself, Mustafa, and my wife Kris. We want to take you on a journey through our love of travel, 
        animals, food, detritis, and other interests of ours. Halloween is our favorite celebratory day, as we love using our imaginations to bring the weird,
        and fabulous costumes to life!

        I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design with a BFA in Photography. I started out sequential art, which still I hold dear. Aside photography,
        I love to draw, paint, ink, and dabble in graffiti art.
